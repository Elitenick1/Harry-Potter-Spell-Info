# Harry-Potter-Spell-Info
In this project, you enter a spell name, and you will recieve in return name(its english name), effect, and what light source it emits. EX: user enters: Aguamenti, and the code returns: name: Water-Making Spell, effect: Conjures water, light: Icy blue. This projects purpose was to learn how to use Linked Lists. I quite like this website and am proud of it.
